%% Undersampling_Step_size - tests if the spatial resolution is high enough 
% Rellie M. Goddard, July 2020

% This function examines how the effective step-size of EBSD maps affects
% the mean line intercept length of a given phase in the map.

%% Required functions:
% * ProcessEBSD_fun.m
% * LinearIntercepts_fun.m
% * Undersampling.fun.m

%% Required user inputs:
% * nx: The number of intercept lines, chosen based on analysis from 
%       No_intercepts_check.m.
% * Int_max: The number of times you want to increase the step-size. The 
%       step-size at an iteration will be Int_max multiplied by the original
%       step-size. For each iteration a .ctf file will be created. 
% * Image_title: Title for figure 
% * Header_size: Number of lines, up to and including the line starting with
%       "phase" in the .ctf file (as seen if opened in a text editor)
% * gb_min: Minimum misorientation angle to define a grain boundary in 
%       degrees. Used for constructing maps
% * sg_min: Minimum misorientation angle to define a subgrain boundary in 
%       degrees. Only used for constructing maps.
% * cutoff: Minimum misorientation angle to define a subgrain boundary in
%       degrees. Used for piezometer calculations. Recommended value is 1.
% * phase: Name of the phase of interest (e.g., 'Forsterite')
% * crystal: Crystal system of the phase to be examined (e.g., 'orthorhombic')
% * test: When set to 1, reduces the size of the input EBSD map by taking
%       every tenth pixel in both the horizontal and vertical direction. Can be 
%       utilized to ensure the script runs correctly for a new sample file or for
%       troubleshooting. During full analysis, test should be set to 0.
% * Phase_map: To output a phase map, set to 1. Othewise, set to 0.
% * Band_contrast: To output a band contrast map, set to 1. Otherwise, set
%       to 0.
%
%% Additional user inputs produced by MTEX
% * CS: Crystal symmetry class variable for all indexed phaes in EBSD map.
% * pname: Path to data (e.g., 'C:/Users/admin/data/')
% * fname: File name combined with path
%
%% Results
% A figure showing the Intercept Variation Factor plotted against the number 
% of pixels per intercept will be produced. See Goddard et al., (submitted) for an
% explanation of the variables. 
%
% The test is considered successful if the measured mean intercept length
% is not sensitive to the effective step size. The presence of an asymptote
% at an intercept variation factor of 1 is evidence that step size is small
% enough to capture the mean intercept length. If such an asymptote doesn't
% exist then either re-map the sample, using a smaller step size, or use the 
% subgrain-size stress measurement as a lower bound.
