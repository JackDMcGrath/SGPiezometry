function Area_Analysis_reduction(config_file)
%% Area_Analysis_reduction - test to see if the map size is large enough
% Rellie M. Goddard, July 2020

% This function examines how the effective map size affects
% the mean line intercept length of a given phase in the map.

%% Required functions:
% * ProcessEBSD_fun.m
% * LinearIntercepts_fun.m

%% Required user inputs:
% * nx: The number of intercept lines, chosen based on analysis from 
%       No_intercepts_check.m.
% * gb_min: Minimum misorientation angle to define a grain boundary in 
%       degrees. Used for constructing m(taken from config)aps.
% * sg_min: Minimum misorientation angle to define a subgrain boundary in 
%       degrees. Only used for constructing maps.
% * cutoff: Minimum misorientation angle to define a subgrain boundary in
%       degrees. Used for piezometer calculations. Recommended value is 1.
% * phase: Name of the phase of interest (e.g., 'Forsterite')
% * crystal: Crystal system of the phase to be examined (e.g., 'orthorhombic')
% * test: When set to 1, reduces the size of the input EBSD map by taking
%       every tenth pixel in both the horizontal and vertical direction. Can be 
%       utilized to ensure the script runs correctly for a new sample file or for
%       troubleshooting. During full analysis, test should be set to 0.
% * Phase_map: To output a phase map, set to 1. Othewise, set to 0.
% * Band_contrast: To output a band contrast map, set to 1. Otherwise, set
%       to 0
%
%% Additional user inputs produced by MTEX
% * CS: Crystal symmetry class variable for all indexed phaes in EBSD map.
% * pname: Path to data (e.g., 'C:/Users/admin/data/')
% * fname: File name combined with path
%
% Results 
%   An EBSD map for each analysis is outputted with a red box outlining the analysed subarea. 
%   A figure showing the intercept analysis of the final subarea. 
%   A figure showing the mean line intercept length plotted against the area as a percentage of the original map. 
%   On the right axis of the same figure the % change of the mean line intercepts length relative to the full map is plotted against map area. 
%
% The test is successful if, as the size of the sub-area increases, the mean intercept length asymptotically approaches the mean for the entire map.  
% For all the samples included in the subgrain-size piezometer, the % change in mean line intercept length relative to the full map was < 5% for a 20% reduction in map area. 
% If the mean line intercept length changes significantly with the reduced map size more maps or larger maps are required to accurately capture the subgrain size.
